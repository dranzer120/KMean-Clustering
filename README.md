# KMean-Clustering
Use a K-means algorithm to perform image classification.
Leveraging Scikit-learn and the MNIST dataset, we will investigate the use of K-means clustering for computer vision.

In this project, the following concepts/tools will be used:

- Preprocess images for clustering
- Deploy K-means clustering algorithms
- Use common metrics to evaluate cluster performance
- Visualize high-dimensional cluster centroids
